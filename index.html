                    function,
                    efficient.
                    I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I
                    even

                    the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made
                    their
                    website and showed
                    it
                    to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
